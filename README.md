Created a sophisticated cryptocurrency application utilizing ReactJS, with real-time data integration from multiple APIs. The application encompasses a range of robust features, including dedicated sections for Coins and Exchanges, as well as an intuitive Home page. Users can seamlessly access Bitcoin's value in multiple currencies, including INR, USD, and EUR. The Coins section offers comprehensive statistics, including price fluctuations over various time spans such as the last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, providing a holistic view of cryptocurrency performance.
